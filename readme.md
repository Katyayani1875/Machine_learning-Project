# Student Performance Indicator

This project predicts the performance of students based on various factors and helps to visualize their expected academic performance. The aim is to create an interactive model that can be used to predict student performance indicators using machine learning algorithms.

## Description

The **Student Performance Indicator** project utilizes machine learning to predict a student's academic performance based on input features such as gender, race or ethnicity, test preparation course, and more. This tool can help students to understand the factors influencing academic performance and make data-driven decisions to improve it.
